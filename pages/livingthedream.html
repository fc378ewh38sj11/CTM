        <h1>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</h1>
        <p><b>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</b> is an upcoming simulation video game for the Nintendo Switch planned for release sometime in 2026. It is the third entry in the Tomodachi Life series, the first entry on a home console, and the latest entry in over eleven years. </p>

      <p>This title has not been officially released, so details on Mii usage may be scarce. Please check Nintendo's website and social media platforms for the latest information.</p>

    <section class="mii-usage">
      <h2>Mii usage</h2>
      <p>As a Tomodachi Life series game, the title is entirely composed of Mii characters. Compared to previous entries in the series (and all other Mii supported titles), Miis have an entirely new design that is cel-shaded and akin to promo artwork used for <b>Tomodachi Collection.</b> Their hair styles are entirely new, with no hair options from the base Mii editor being shown off yet. Some eyebrow types are also brand new, Miis now have ears, and several face part textures have been altered. For example, the default nose part is more pointed and sharp looking.</p>

    <h2>Trivia</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>This title is not the first instance of Mii characters with ears. Miis are seen with ears in a pre-queue video at Super Nintendo World's <b>Mario Kart: Bowser Challenge</b> at Universal Studios theme parks, beta designs of Miis shown at E3 2006 suggest that they were originally planned to have ears, and elves seen in Miitopia have elf-style ears attached to their heads. </li>
    <br>
    <li>A 2014 press release from Nintendo in response to the absence of same-sex relationships for Miis in Tomodachi Life states that they will "strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players" if another installment in the series is produced. It is unknown if this confirms support for same-sex relationships in this title. </li>
    <br>
    <li>The release of <b>Nintendo Switch Sports</b> to the announcement of Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream is a span of exactly 1,063 days; the longest drought for Mii supported titles on a system.</li>
