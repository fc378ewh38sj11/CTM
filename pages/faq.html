        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    </section>

<h3>What is this website?</h3>
This site is an archive of every known title that features support for Nintendo's Mii characters across all platforms. You can browse and sort software based on how Miis are used in gameplay.
<h32>What qualifies as a Mii supported title?</h3>
A Mii supported title is any piece of software that uses Nintendo's proprietary system to render Mii characters, internally known as the Face Library. Therefore, the following usages are not counted:
<ul>
  <li>Titles that only use static or pre-rendered Mii assets (e.g., profile icons on Switch, Trauma Team, WarioWare: Move It!, the DS version of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time)</li>
  <li>Fan-made software or mods using recreations or recompilations of the Face Library</li>
  <li>Cancelled projects or titles where Face Library data exists in the files but is unused</li>
</ul>
<h3>What do the categories mean?</h2>
<h4>Playable / Interactive</h4>
Mii characters can be selected and directly controlled or interacted with by the player. In some cases, Miis may need to be unlocked or are only usable in specific modes.
<h4>Background / Non-Playable</h4>
Miis may appear in the background of gameplay, or have a role in a title where they cannot be directly controlled like bystanders, spectators, CPU-controlled teammates or inhabitants of a title's setting. These may come from your system, friends list, the game itself, etc.
<h4>Icon / Avatar</h4>
Mii characters will represent a player or character in gameplay, save files, StreetPass and SpotPass encounters, Miiverse communication, or other UI elements. Sometimes they're static, expressive, 2D, 3D... it all depends on the title. This role is usually pretty boring, but some software may use Mii portraits in pretty neat ways.
<h3>Why though?</h3>
Miis are surprisingly versatile: arguably among the most adaptable characters in gaming. While they’re best known for motion controlled titles like Wii Sports or quirky smaller games like Tomodachi Life and StreetPass Mii Plaza, their cameos and roles extend far beyond that; appearing in over 350 titles.
<br><br>
Over the years, they’ve crossed paths with everyone from Mario and Sonic to Mickey Mouse, Hatsune Miku, Alex Trebek, Howie Mandel, Billy Blanks, Danica Patrick, and Lionel Messi. They’ve raced, danced, explored, became doctors and army recruits, and stood on Olympic podiums. Miis are the ultimate everyman, and this archive aims to capture the full legacy of their bizarre yet charming adventures.
